Description: Bringing together tools for modeling drying and soaking (rehydration)
	kinetics of seeds. This package contains several widely used predictive models
	(e.g.: da Silva et al., 2018). As these are nonlinear, the functions are interactive-based 
	and easy-to-use. Least squares estimates are obtained with just a few visual adjustments 
	of the initial parameter values.
